## Personal life

Meet Tommy, the unconventional wizard who prefers jeans, a t-shirt, and a trusty laptop as his magical tools rather than the traditional long robe, pointed hat, and wand. His journey into the world of wizardry began in the late 2012s when he embarked on a path as a tech specialist in information security. Little did he know that this would be just the beginning of his relentless pursuit of the most extraordinary spells in technological advancement.

Unlike the renowned wizards who attended prestigious schools of witchcraft and wizardry, Tommy's magical education was entirely self-taught. He embarked on his quest by immersing himself in the virtual realms of IRCd channels and actively participating in research initiatives. It was during this time that the realms of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing captivated his interest. Tommy was fascinated by the idea of commanding inanimate objects to perform tasks that were previously only achievable through the casting of spells. He could now summon a magical creature that summarized the day's hottest topics, effortlessly translate lengthy texts in foreign languages, or even receive recommendations for items that would make one look superb, despite their unnecessary nature.

Presently, Tommy resides in Pematang Siantar, Indonesia, together with his best friends, Frengky Ardian Batubara, and their one beloved dogs and cat, who occasionally serve as willing subjects for his experiments in the art of potions. When he's not preoccupied with conjuring mouse ears or attempting to sprout leaves from his nose, Tommy assumes various roles as a founder, advisor, and investor for a multitude of internet companies. In recent years, he has led a team of talented young witches and wizards, working together to craft advanced spells and enchantments.

Tommy's unconventional approach to wizardry has proven to be remarkably successful. His dedication to pushing the boundaries of technology and discovering new magical spells has led him down a path that few could have imagined. By embracing the power of modern tools and techniques, Tommy has demonstrated that true wizardry knows no bounds. Through his extraordinary journey, he has inspired countless others to seek magic in the realms of science and technology.

So, the next time you encounter Tommy, don't be surprised by his casual attire and laptop in hand. Behind that unassuming exterior lies a brilliant wizard who continues to shape the world of magic with his innovative spells and enchantments.
